pypi package for topsis

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a method for ranking alternatives based on multiple criteria. It's a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. 

How it works 
Create a normalized decision matrix
Calculate the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution
Calculate the distance between each alternative and the positive and negative ideal solutions
Compare the distances to rank the alternatives
Benefits of TOPSIS 
Simple to understand
Efficient to compute
Can measure relative performance of alternatives
Can incorporate relative weights of criterion importance
Can be used to select alternatives with the best combination of beneficial criteria and the worst combination of cost criteria
Applications of TOPSIS 
Selecting prominent students
Choosing the optimal type of spillway
Making decisions in other fields where multiple criteria are important
