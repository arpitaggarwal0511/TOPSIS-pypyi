# TOPSIS

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a method for ranking alternatives based on multiple criteria. It's a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. 
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## How it works 


Create a normalized decision matrix

Calculate the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution

Calculate the distance between each alternative and the positive and negative ideal solutions

Compare the distances to rank the alternatives

## Benefits of TOPSIS

Simple to understand

Efficient to compute

Can measure relative performance of alternatives

Can incorporate relative weights of criterion importance

Can be used to select alternatives with the best combination of beneficial criteria and the worst combination of cost criteria


## Applications of TOPSIS 

Selecting prominent students

Choosing the optimal type of spillway

Making decisions in other fields where multiple criteria are important
